\arguments{
\item{nsims}{number of simulations to run (approximate)}

\item{cores}{number of cores in parallel to process}

\item{schedule}{games to play}

\item{scores}{Season to this point}

\item{params}{The named list containing m, rho, beta, eta, and k. See \link{updateDC} for information on the params list}

\item{season_sofar}{The results of the season to date}

\item{likelihood_graphic}{whether to create a likelihood graphic}

\item{odds_table}{a table of odds for all games in schedule. Null, unless provided. Should be similar to the output of \code{remainderSeasonDC(odds=TRUE)},
which is a data.frame of HomeTeam, AwayTeam, HomeWin, AwayWin, Draw, GameID and Date}
