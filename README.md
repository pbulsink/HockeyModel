# To Do
- Twitter user [@MOCallanain](https://www.twitter.com/MOCallanain) highlighted that the predicted tie rate is < ~0.2, when in actuality it's higher. Likely due to teams playing for loser point, can we parameterize the model to include a tie boost? Model currently rescales to increase odds to a reasonable amount.
